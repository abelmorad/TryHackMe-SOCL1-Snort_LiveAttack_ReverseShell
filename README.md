# Documentation: TryHackMe SOC L1 - Snort Live Attack Challenge - Reverse Shell

## 1. Introduction

- The room invites you to a challenge where you will investigate a series of traffic data and stop malicious activity work with Snort to analyze live and captured traffic
### Objective
- Analyze the traffic with Snort and identify the anomaly first. Then you can create a rule to stop the reverse shell and capture the flag

## 2. Setup 
### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of network security concepts
- Access to the TryHackMe platform

## 3. Procedures

- **Start Snort in sniffer mode and try to figure out the attack source, service, and port.**
  - In the CLI enter `snort -vde` to display the packet data, headers as well as the data link layer headers
  - Analyze the packet and look for anomalies
    - This IP with this port keeps coming up in the packets

    - It seems suspicious let us find out how often this port comes up. Enter `snort -vde | grep 4444`
      - ![snortcha8](https://github.com/abelmorad/TryHackMe-SOCL1-Snort_LiveAttack_ReverseShell/assets/110463619/41d15d3f-df71-4c46-9ae4-fe32dba5e966)
    - We figured that the IP is using port 4444 which is a default listening port for Metasploit
      - ![snortcha4](https://github.com/abelmorad/TryHackMe-SOCL1-Snort_LiveAttack_ReverseShell/assets/110463619/ffd8c471-b484-42df-beb2-971ae00526f5)
    - Let's create an IPS rule in Snort to stop the attack
    - Gain root access using `sudo su` then in the root directory and navigate to the rules directory. Enter `cd /etc/snort/rules`
    - In the rules directory there are various rule sets available we need to open local.rules and add our rule. Enter `nano local.rule`
    - Let's add our rule. Here we are rejecting any inbound and outbound traffic coming from this IP address
      - ![snortcha6](https://github.com/abelmorad/TryHackMe-SOCL1-Snort_LiveAttack_ReverseShell/assets/110463619/4f445064-3c21-4382-ab9f-2e6e818c55b0)
    - To run Snort in IPS mode. Enter `snort -c /etc/snort/rules/local.rules` so we can use the rule we created
    - We are successful in rejecting the packets. We captured the flag!

      - ![snortcha11](https://github.com/abelmorad/TryHackMe-SOCL1-Snort_LiveAttack_ReverseShell/assets/110463619/5dc966a1-3ccc-4b49-9070-bf661f475ec0)

## 4. Attack Detection 

- Observe the console output or log files for alerts generated by the attack.
- Note down alert details like timestamp, source IP, destination IP, type of alert, and ports.

## 5. Conclusion

- We successfully blocked the attacker's IP preventing the attack and captured the flag. Snorts IPS capability is an effective tool to prevent such attacks.
- Another effective solution to prevent brute-force attacks is to have a strong password or Use a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks
